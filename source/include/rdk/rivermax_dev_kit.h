/**
 * @brief: Main API of Rivermax Dev Kit.
 *
 * The Rivermax Dev Kit provides a comprehensive set of APIs for developing
 * high-performance applications using the NVIDIA Rivermax library.
 *
 * ## Module Organization and Namespace Structure
 * The kit is organized into four primary modules, each with its corresponding namespace:
 * - Apps: Application-level functionality (@ref rdk::apps)
 * - IO Node: Input/output management (@ref rdk::io_node)
 * - Services: Supporting services (@ref rdk::services)
 * - Core: Essential C++ Rivermax components and interfaces (@ref rdk::core)
 *
 * All modules are contained within the "rdk" namespace.
 *
 * ## Navigation
 * - Module headers are located in their respective include directories
 *       - Example: core/include/rdk/core/core.h
 * - Interface files are in subdirectories of their module
 *       - Example: core/stream/send/include/rdk/core/stream/send/media_stream.h
 *

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * Rivermax Dev Kit offers flexible inclusion options to suit your development needs:
 *
 * 1. Include the entire API with a single header:
 *    ```
 *    #include "rdk/rivermax_dev_kit.h"
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. Include only specific modules you need, for example:
 *    ```
 *    #include "rdk/core/core.h"
 *    #include "rdk/services/services.h"
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. Include individual components for minimal dependencies:
 *    ```
 *    #include "rdk/core/stream/send/media_stream.h"
 *    ```
 *
 * Choose the approach that best balances convenience and compilation efficiency for your application.
